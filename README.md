Football Player Overall Rating Prediction
This project explores the power of machine learning in predicting a football player's overall rating using real-world data. Built with precision, each step—from data cleaning to model optimization—was crafted to ensure reliable and explainable results.

At its core, the pipeline combines a mix of numerical and binary-encoded features that truly capture what makes a footballer stand out. By focusing on the most influential attributes, the model delivers not only strong performance but also insights into the factors that shape a player's perceived quality.

What This Project Does
The full pipeline begins with raw data and transforms it into a refined dataset. It filters out noise by focusing only on features with a meaningful correlation to the player's overall rating. Using advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, it trains and evaluates models to determine which one performs best.

The project doesn't just stop at good results—it dives deeper by identifying the most important features. These include a player’s release clause, market value, age, potential, and weekly wage. Together, they offer a clear view of what drives high player ratings in the football world.

Why It Matters
Understanding what influences a footballer's rating can be crucial for scouts, analysts, and even game developers. This project simplifies that process, offering a lean version of the model that uses only the five most impactful features. It trades complexity for clarity without sacrificing much performance.

What You’ll Learn
By studying this codebase, you’ll learn how to:

Clean and prepare football data for machine learning

Select relevant features based on correlation and importance

Train and fine-tune powerful regression models

Interpret feature contributions to model predictions

Final Thoughts
This isn't just a prediction engine,it's a conversation starter for how data can reflect real-world talent. It proves that behind every high-rated player, there's a story hidden in numbers, waiting to be told.
